VoxelEngine CHANGELOG
	v0:
		v0.1:
			
			- 3D cube rendered with Minecraft dirt block texture
			- Move-able camera that transforms everything in the world, the camera
			  doesn't move, the world does
			- FPS capped at 60
			- FileLogging system, if there is a problem, look at latest.log
		
		v0.2:
		
			- Multi-threaded Flat terrain generation:
				One thread - terrain generation
				another thread - terrain cleanup
				another thread - rest of game
			- FPS capped at 120
			
			v0.2.1:
			
				- Terrain clean up is removed, voxels are just not rendered.
				- HashMap used to optmise the entity rendering method; 
				  TexturedModel as key and Entity as value, so if an Entity uses
				  a TexturedModel that already exists in the game state, it just
				  uses the originally created one.
				- Vertical and Horizontal slabs added but not used in game
				- Block texture changed to my own dirt texture (not as good
				  looking).
				- Window title changed from Voxel Engine vx.x to
				  GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine vx.x.x .
				- Sprinting added, press control to sprint.
		
		v0.3:
		
			- Terrain generation done in chunks - bogs FPS down a lot more.
			- Old Chunk.java renamed to TerrainGenerator.java.
			- new Chunk.java just holds chunk data.
			- FPS capped at 255
			- FOV changed from 70 to 110
			
		v0.4:
		
			- per-block Texture atlasing
			- New seperate Block type, only difference is the UV coordinates
			- FPS capped at 60
			- Way render distance is calculated has been tweaked slightly
			
			v0.4.1:
			
				- Fixed window title to read GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine v0.4.1

			v0.4.2:
			
				- Added the option to only generate a single block. This is useful
				  when taking screenshots where you have to be able to see all
				  sides of the voxel
		
		v0.5:
		
			- Chunk Mesh generation, where all the faces in all the blocks in a chunk
			  are looped through and if the faces is open to air, then add it to the
			  chunk mesh which is drawn in one draw call instead of a draw call per
			  block.
			- FPS capped at 64
			- Render distance is 22 chunks
			- Perlin (maybe value, not sure) noise generation for height of the chunk
			- There is a bad memory issue so don't run the game for more than a couple
			  of minutes as the amount of RAM the application takes up will increase
			  indefinitely
