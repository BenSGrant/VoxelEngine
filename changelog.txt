VoxelEngine CHANGELOG
	v0:
		v0.1 - (16/5/21):
			
			- 3D cube rendered with Minecraft dirt block texture
			- Move-able camera that transforms everything in the world, the camera
			  doesn't move, the world does
			- FPS capped at 60
			- FileLogging system, if there is a problem, look at latest.log
		
		v0.2 - (17/5/21):
		
			- Multi-threaded Flat terrain generation:
				One thread - terrain generation
				another thread - terrain cleanup
				another thread - rest of game
			- FPS capped at 120
			
			v0.2.1 - (17/5/21):
			
				- Terrain clean up is removed, voxels are just not rendered.
				- HashMap used to optmise the entity rendering method; 
				  TexturedModel as key and Entity as value, so if an Entity uses
				  a TexturedModel that already exists in the game state, it just
				  uses the originally created one.
				- Vertical and Horizontal slabs added but not used in game
				- Block texture changed to my own dirt texture (not as good
				  looking).
				- Window title changed from Voxel Engine vx.x to
				  GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine vx.x.x .
				- Sprinting added, press control to sprint.
		
		v0.3 - (18/5/21):
		
			- Terrain generation done in chunks - bogs FPS down a lot more.
			- Old Chunk.java renamed to TerrainGenerator.java.
			- new Chunk.java just holds chunk data.
			- FPS capped at 255
			- FOV changed from 70 to 110
			
		v0.4 - (18/5/21):
		
			- per-block Texture atlasing
			- New seperate Block type, only difference is the UV coordinates
			- FPS capped at 60
			- Way render distance is calculated has been tweaked slightly
			
			v0.4.1 - (18/5/21):
			
				- Fixed window title to read GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine v0.4.1

			v0.4.2 - (18/5/21):
			
				- Added the option to only generate a single block. This is useful
				  when taking screenshots where you have to be able to see all
				  sides of the voxel
		
		v0.5 - (20/5/21):
		
			- Chunk Mesh generation, where all the faces in all the blocks in a chunk
			  are looped through and if the faces is open to air, then add it to the
			  chunk mesh which is drawn in one draw call instead of a draw call per
			  block.
			- FPS capped at 64
			- Render distance is 22 chunks
			- Perlin (maybe value, not sure) noise generation for height of the chunk
			- There is a bad memory issue so DO NOT RUN THE GAME FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE
			  OR TWO (depending on your computer specs) AT A TIME as the amount of RAM
			  the application takes up will increase indefinitely.
		
		v0.6 - (1/6/21):
		
			- Blocks that use a texture atlas now work in world generation as all blocks 
			  now share the same texture atlas that has a texture for every side of every 
			  block.
			- RAM build up problem reduced but not fixed. The cause appears to be that 
			  there is no chunk unloading yet.
			- Stone blocks are generated ~9 blocks below the surface, dirt 1 block, grass
			  blocks on top.
			- FPS capped at 50 (forgot to change it before release)
			- Window size 480x894 (also forgot to change before release)
			- Window title now reads GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine v0.6
			
			v0.6.1 - (1/6/21):
			
				- Window size now 1080p
				- Refresh rate capped at 255
				- Window title now reads GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine v0.6.1
				
		v0.7 - (2/6/21):
		
			- FOG. The further away something is from the camera, the more it gets blended
			  into the skycolour.
			- Where there used to be gaps in the ground there is now dirt patches
