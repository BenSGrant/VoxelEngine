VoxelEngine CHANGELOG
	v0:
		v0.1:
			
			- 3D cube rendered with Minecraft dirt block texture
			- Move-able camera that transforms everything in the world, the camera
			  doesn't move, the world does
			- FPS capped at 60
			- FileLogging system, if there is a problem, look at latest.log
		
		v0.2:
		
			- Multi-threaded Flat terrain generation:
				One thread - terrain generation
				another thread - terrain cleanup
				another thread - rest of game
			- FPS capped at 120
			
			v0.2.1:
			
				- Terrain clean up is removed, voxels are just not rendered.
				- HashMap used to optmise the entity rendering method; 
				  TexturedModel as key and Entity as value, so if an Entity uses
				  a TexturedModel that already exists in the game state, it just
				  uses the originally created one.
				- Vertical and Horizontal slabs added but not used in game
				- Block texture changed to my own dirt texture (not as good
				  looking).
				- Window title changed from Voxel Engine vx.x to
				  GaryTheBlobfish::VoxelEngine vx.x.x .
				- Sprinting added, press control to sprint.
		
		v0.3:
		
			- Terrain generation done in chunks - bogs FPS down a lot more.
			- Old Chunk.java renamed to TerrainGenerator.java.
			- new Chunk.java just holds chunk data.
			- FPS capped at 255
			
		v0.4:
		
			- per-block Texture atlasing
			- New seperate Block type, only difference is the UV coordinates
			- FPS capped at 60
			- Way render distance is calculated has been tweaked slightly
